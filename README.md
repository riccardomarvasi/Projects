# Projects
This repository contains projects that were part of my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence. Please note that I collaborated with other individuals as co-authors for these projects.

## Project 1: EMOTION DISCOVERY AND MOOD FLIP REASONING IN CONVERSATIONS (EDIREF)
- **Description:** A BERT model is employed to classify the emotion associated to the utterances of a series of dialogues taken from the F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV show. Also, the model is able to recognize the particular utterance(s) triggering a change in the mood of the speakers. 
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers
- **Results:** The results highlight the promising impact of BERT models for emotion classification tasks. Particularly, the non-trivial challenge of recognizing mood flip utterances demonstrates the effectiveness of complex models like BERT in handling this kind of conversational analysis.

## Project 2: NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PART OF SPEECH (POS) TAGGING
- **Descritpion:** Three recurrent neural models based on Bidirectional LSTM layers are employed to perform a Part Of Speech (POS) task.
- **Technologies:** Python, Keras, GloVE.
- **Results:** For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the relative report.

## Project 3: MULTI-LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION WITH TRANSFORMERS
- **Description:** A transformer-based architecture is employed to perform a text classification. In particular the classification is about the particular human emotion related to the text. A comparison between the transformer-based architecture and more traditional machine learning baselines is provided.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers.
- **Results:** For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the relative report.

## Project 4: PAPER SELECTION AND INFORMATION EXTRACTION IN HEALTHCARE DOMAIN
- **Description:** This project compares traditional TF-IDF representations with dense BERT representations in a paper selection and information extraction task within the healthcare domain. The task involves identifying relevant papers for a systematic review on Wilson's disease.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers.
- **Results:** Results highlight the superiority of more recent transformer-based dense representation of documents with respect to old sparse representations.

## Project 5: MOTION  DEBLURRING IN IMAGES USING UNET 
- **Description:** This project aims to perform de-blurring of purposely motion-blurred images. MSE is then employed to compare the de-noised image with the original one.
- **Technologies:** Python, Keras, TensorFlow.
- **Results:** An average MSE of 0.001 is obtained

## Project 6: EXPLANATION TECHNIQUES FOR BLACK BOX MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
- **Description:** This project tests the most famous explainability techniques (Lime, Dice and Shap) together with a custom Anova-based explainability algorithm. This study is based on the models defined and optimized by another team at the University of Bologna, working with data coming out of a "robot dance evaluation performance". More details are presented in the report.
- **Technologies:** Python, Dice, Lime, Shap, ANOVA.
- **My contributions:** For this project, my primary focus was on implementing the LIME explanations. Additionally, I made contributions to the development of the custom ANOVA algorithm and to the following study related to the ANOVA assumptions.
- **Results:** The study explains why the ANOVA assumptions do not hold for any kind of data, and in particular why the algorithm based on it is not ok for this dataset, and provides an overview on the most important features for the "robot dance performance evaluation".

## Project 7: OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS FOR REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS
- **Description:** This study explores 3 different optimization techniques to solve the same problem, specifically the "Multiple Couriers Planning Problem".
- **Technologies:** Constraint Programming (CP), SMT, Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Python.
- **My contributions:** For this project, my contributions are limited to the SMT and CP part.
- **Results:** For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the relative report.
