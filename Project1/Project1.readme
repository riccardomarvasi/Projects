## Project 1: EMOTION DISCOVERY AND MOOD FLIP REASONING IN CONVERSATIONS (EDIREF)
- **Description:** A BERT model is employed to classify the emotion associated to the utterances of a series of dialogues taken from the F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV show. Also, the model is able to recognize the particular utterance(s) triggering a change in the mood of the speakers. 
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers
- **Results:** The results highlight the promising impact of BERT models for emotion classification tasks. Particularly, the non-trivial challenge of recognizing mood flip utterances demonstrates the effectiveness of complex models like BERT in handling this kind of conversational analysis.
